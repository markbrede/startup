# Notes for CS260

## 3 main take aways
1. Git and GitHub work hand in hand. GitHub allows me to see the things I do in Git more clearly.
2. How to push and pull to and from GitHub. It is important to be succinct with where and when you push and pull.
3. You should commit consistently and often. Doing so allows others to see the small changes you have made with each commit.
