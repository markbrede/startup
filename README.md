# ELEVATOR PITCH
## Sep 17 2024 - Pitch
Often the small expenses we spend on our vehicles go unaccounted for, leaving us underestimating the true cost of owning and maintaining our vehicles. My website, AutoExpenseTracker.com, is a simple yet powerful tool for vehicle owners to track and manage their automotive expenses. By creating an account, a user can easily log their vehicle's make and model, enter expenses like fuel, insurance, and maintenance, and have everything neatly organized in one place. With real-time cost calculations such as cost per mile and total vehicle expenses, users can make informed decisions on whether to maintain their current vehicle or invest in a new one. This website is appealing to a large number of people because it allows people to take control of their vehicle costs and optimize your financial decisions.

## Sep 14 2024 - Key Features
1. **User Accounts**: Sign-up and login functionality with personalized expense tracking.
2. **Vehicle Cards**: Add and view vehicles, each with its own expense summary.
3. **Expense Tracking**: Log expenses (fuel, insurance, maintenance) and categorize them.
